DATA BINDING
    Data Binding is the process of connecting the view element or user interface,
    with the data which populates it.

    In ReactJS, components are rendered to the user interface and the component’s 
    logic contains the data to be displayed in the view(UI).
    The connection between the data to be displayed in the view and the component’s
    logic is called data binding in ReactJS.

STRICT MODE IN REACT 
    <React.StrictMode>
    Identifying components with unsafe lifecycles
    Warning about legacy string ref API usage
    Warning about deprecated findDOMNode usage
    Detecting unexpected side effects
    Detecting legacy context API
    Detecting unsafe effects
    </React.StrictMode>

PERFORMANCE
    Performance optimization tool - santry - (check how much trafic,time of request, individual alerts )

    Profiler - tool available for react development tools extension that you can add to your browser
    in this tool we have a various graphs, we can check which component is taking much time to render and need to pay attention
    and how many time perticular component is rendered.

    PureComponent
    useMemo
    use local veriable 
    avoide console logs avaoide commentted code 
    if we are using list anywhere must give unique key to each element.
    check the console if it is giving any warning try to resolve that.
    implement scroll and filter api's if list is longer.
    react.lazy();
    cherry picking() method , import only those f or v or mod that is required instead of importing complete module.
    web pack bundle analyser plug in ( check which module is havier or larger)
